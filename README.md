# 2WD-Self-Balancing-Robot-using-ESP32-Bluetooth-Controlled-
A 2WD self-balancing robot using ESP32 and MPU6050 sensor maintains balance through a PID control system. It adjusts motor speed to stay upright and can be controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone. The project demonstrates real-time feedback, stability, and embedded control concepts.
